# Google Desktop Apps for Mac OS X
We all use Google Apps everyday-Docs, Sheets, Gmail, Drive, etc.

Wouldn't it be nice to have your Gmail as an application that can remain open without needing to load Chrome and navigate to Gmail? Well that is the purpose of creating these various desktop Google Apps.

The first idea for this came from [/u/chriskol](https://github.com/chriskol) who created the first Google Docs and Keep versions. I discovered his github page when I realized that Google took Google Keep off the Chrome Web Store as an app to use on your desktop, opting to just make it available in the browser. I brought his code for Docs and Keep over to this repo to put everything in one centralized place.

# How Do I Download One, Two, or All of them?
You have two options:
1. Download the apps from the website: [Google Apps for Mac](https://www.googleappsformac.com). (The easy option)
2. Download the .zip files from this github repo. (The barely harder option)

### Going to download from github?
1. Download all the apps by downloading the folder in this repo called [**Google Apps for Mac OS X**]()
2. Download individual apps by going to the individual folders for each application and download the .zip file in the folder. You do _not_ need to download the whole folder, just the .zip file, i.e. inside the Gmail folder you'd download [**Gmail-Desktop-App.zip**]() and unzip it.





# How is it Made?
It is really simple. They are built with Javascript and MacGap, just one line of code to wrap the particular Google app in a window on your desktop. All made possible by [MacGap](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap2). Build your own wrapper for an HTML5 app using instructions on [MacGap-rb](https://github.com/maccman/macgap-rb).
